    - total budget 
    - average math score 
    - average reading score 
    - percentage of students who passed math 
    - percentage of students who passed reading

    - schools that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher 
    - passing rates 
<br><br>

## Highest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
- Top five schools based on highest % of students passing both math and reading were obtained
<br><br>

## Lowest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
- Top five schools based on highest % of students passing both math and reading were obtained
<br><br>

## Math Scores by Grade
- Average math scores calculated across all grades for each school
<br><br>

## Reading Scores by Grade
- Average reading scores calculated across all grades for each school
<br><br>

## Scores by School Spending
- Data was binned by spending ranges per student, then the following was calculated and put into a DataFrame:
    - average test scores (math and reading)
    - % of students with math scores of 70 or higher 
    - % of students reading scores of 70 or higher 
    - % of students that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher 
<br><br>

## Scores by School Size

    - % of students that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher 
<br><br>

## Scores by School Type

    - average test scores (math and reading)
    - % of students with math scores of 70 or higher 
    - % of students reading scores of 70 or higher 
    - % of students that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher
